Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. 
The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. 
In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012â€”achieving a mAPof 53.3%. 
Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. 
We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture.
